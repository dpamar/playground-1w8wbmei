# BrainFuck part 2 - Working with arrays

The goal of this playground is to introduce two different ways to handle data arrays using the BF language.

At the end of this playground, you should be able to
* define an array in memory composed by non-null cells
* Move along this array
* Shift the whole array to the left or right in memory
* Compute array length
* Reverse an array (in place)
* Acces array item from random index
* define another kind of more complex array that supports null values

Have fun !
